          * Documentation and wikis.
          *Community and open source.
          * Security and compliance.

4.Branching and Merging in GitHub:
What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
   Branching-Branches in GitHub (and Git in general) are an essential feature that allow you to diverge from the main line of development and work on changes or new features in isolation.

   IMPORTANCE OF BRANCHES.
    *Isolation of changes.
    *Parallel development
    *Collaboration.
    * Code review and testing.

    PROCESS OF BRANCHING, MAKING CHANGES AND MERGING.
     1.BRANCHING
       *To create a branch in Git, you use the git branch command. 'git branch feature-branch'
       *Then, switch to the new branch with 'git checkout feature-branch'
       *Alternatively, you can create and switch to the new branch in one command 'git checkout -b feature-branch'.

    2.MAKING CHANGES.
      *Use the command -'git add .'
                       -'git commit -m "description"

    3.MERGING
      * A reviewer can merge the pull request by clicking the "Merge pull request" button on the GitHub interface.
      *Choose the merge method (merge commit, squash and merge, or rebase and merge) and confirm the merge.


5.Pull Requests and Code Reviews:
What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
Pull request-Is a feature that facilitates code reviews and collaboration by allowing developers to propose changes to a codebase.

HOW TO PULL REQUEST FACILITATE CODE REVIEWS AND COLLABORATION.
    *Discussion and feedback.
    * Code review
    * Approval workflow.
    *Continuous integration.
    *Documentation and traceability

STEPS TO CREATE AND REVIEW A PULL REQUEST AND REWIEW.
A.PULL REQUEST
  *Create a new branch for your changes
      ie;git checkout -b feature-branch
  *Make changes to the code, stage, and commit them:
       ie;- git add .
          - git commit -m "Description of changes"
  *Push the branch to GitHub
      ie; git push origin feature-branch

B.REVIEW PULL REQUEST.
   i.Access the Pull Request:
      *Navigate to the "Pull requests" tab in the repository.
      *Click on the pull request you want to review.
    ii.Review the Changes:
       *Use the "Files changed" tab to see a diff of the changes.
       *Comment on specific lines by clicking the plus icon next to the line number.
       *General comments can be added in the "Conversation" tab.
    iii.Request Changes or Approve:
       *If changes are needed, click "Request changes" and provide feedback on what needs to be addressed.
       *If the changes are satisfactory, click "Approve."
     iv.Merge the Pull Request:
       *Once the pull request has been reviewed and approved, it can be merged. This can be done by the reviewer or the person who created the pull request, depending on the project's workflow.
       *Click the "Merge pull request" button.
       *Choose the merge method (merge commit, squash and merge, or rebase and merge) and confirm the merge.

   
6.GitHub Actions:
Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
  -GitHub Actions is a powerful feature of GitHub that allows you to automate workflows directly within your GitHub repository.

  HOW ACTIONS WORK
        *Workflows: Defined in YAML files, workflows are automated processes that are triggered by events. Each workflow can consist of multiple jobs that run in parallel or sequentially.

        *Events: Workflows are triggered by events such as pushes to a repository, pull requests, or scheduled intervals.

        *Jobs: A workflow is composed of one or more jobs. Each job runs on a virtual machine runner and can include multiple steps.

       *Steps: Each job consists of steps, which are individual tasks that are executed sequentially within a job. Steps can run shell commands or use actions.

       *Actions: Actions are reusable units of code that can perform tasks such as checking out code, setting up a language runtime, or running tests. GitHub provides a marketplace with pre-built actions.

7.Introduction to Visual Studio:
 -Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight, open-source code editor that is highly extensible and customizable.

 KEY FEATURES
   *Lightweight and fast.
   *Built-in git integration.
   *Extensibility

         REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE.
         Project Overview
--Imagine a team of developers working on a web application project that includes a front-end built with React and a back-end API built with Node.js. The team uses GitHub for version control and collaboration and Visual Studio as their primary development environment.

      Workflow
   a.Initial Setup
The team creates a new repository on GitHub and clones it to their local machines using Visual Studio.
   b.Branching Strategy
Each developer creates a feature branch for the task they are working on. For example, a developer might create a branch named feature/user-authentication to implement user login functionality.
   c.Development and Commits
*Developers make changes to the code in their respective branches. They use Visual Studio to write code, debug, and test locally.
*Commits are made frequently with meaningful messages, and changes are pushed to the corresponding feature branches on GitHub.
   d.Pull Requests and Code Reviews
*Once a feature is complete, the developer opens a pull request on GitHub to merge their feature branch into the main branch.
*Team members review the pull request, leaving inline comments and suggestions. Visual Studio allows them to view these comments and address feedback directly in the IDE.
*After the review, the pull request is approved and merged.
   e.Issue Tracking
*Bugs and feature requests are tracked using GitHub Issues. Developers link their commits and pull requests to relevant issues to provide context and ensure traceability.
   f.Automated Testing and Deployment
*The team sets up GitHub Actions to run automated tests on every push to the main branch. If tests pass, the application is automatically built and deployed to a staging environment.
*Visual Studio provides feedback on the status of these automated workflows, allowing developers to quickly identify and fix issues.
    g.Real-time Collaboration
*For pair programming or troubleshooting, developers use Visual Studio Live Share to collaborate in real-time. They can edit and debug code together, share terminals, and more.
